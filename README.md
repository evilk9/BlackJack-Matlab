# BlackJack-Matlab

ETA 26th April 2016. 

A Blackjack game made in Matlab for 1st Year, Semester 1 University Course: Introduction To Programming For Engineers. 

First "large" coding task that I have undertaken and rushed over a couple of days: therefore code is extremely messy. 

Serves as a basis for how far I have improved and how much can be accomplished in a short span of time.
